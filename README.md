# DebateSimulator
This is a debate&amp; negotiation simulator. It solves problem by simulating the debate or negotiation process using chatGPT.

Here we simulate how to solve disputes by simulating the Arbitration process in court, where the claimant, respondent and arbitrator take turns to present their evidences, response the the claim or make judgements.

Through the debate, the parties are expect to reach an agreement on, for example, the final prices of projects.

This first version is completely improvise, we will set rules and regulate the arbitration process, towards reducing hallucinations as much as possible.
