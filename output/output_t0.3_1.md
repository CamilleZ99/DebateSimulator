(respondent): I understand the Claimant's position regarding the outstanding design fee, but I would like to present evidence that the delay in payment was due to the Claimant's failure to meet the agreed-upon design specifications. The design was incomplete and did not meet the requirements outlined in the contract, which caused delays in the construction process. I have documentation to support this claim and would like to request that the Arbitration Center consider this evidence in rendering a fair decision.
(respondent): I also want to bring to the attention of the Arbitration Center that the Claimant did not provide timely updates on the progress of the design, which further delayed the construction process. I have emails and correspondence to support this claim. I believe that both parties have a responsibility to fulfill their obligations under the contract, and I am willing to work towards a solution that is fair and reasonable for both parties.
(claimant): I understand the Respondent's concerns, but I would like to present evidence that the delay in payment was not due to any failure on our part to meet the design specifications. We completed the design according to the contract requirements and submitted it for approval in a timely manner. The delay in payment has caused significant financial hardship for our company, and we believe that the Respondent's actions were malicious. We request that the Arbitration Center consider our evidence and award us the outstanding design fee, delay liquidated damages, and arbitration fees as stated in our claim.
(claimant): We have provided all necessary documentation and correspondence to support our claim. We understand the Respondent's concerns regarding the design specifications, but we believe that any issues with the design were minor and did not significantly delay the construction process. We are willing to work towards a compromise that is fair and reasonable for both parties, but we maintain our claim for the outstanding design fee, delay liquidated damages, and arbitration fees.
(claimant): We also want to emphasize that the delay in payment was not due to any fault on our part. We fulfilled our obligations under the contract and submitted the design for approval in a timely manner. The delay in payment has caused significant financial hardship for our company, and we believe that the Respondent should be held responsible for the delay liquidated damages and arbitration fees. We are open to discussing a compromise that is fair and reasonable for both parties.
(arbitrator): Thank you for presenting your claims and evidence. As the arbitrator, I would like to clarify a few points. First, it is important to establish whether the Claimant fulfilled their obligations under the contract regarding the design specifications. Second, we need to determine whether the delay in payment was due to the Claimant's failure to meet the design specifications or if it was caused by the Respondent's actions. Finally, we need to consider whether there is a fair and reasonable compromise that can be reached between the parties. 

With that in mind, I would like to ask the Respondent to present their evidence regarding the Claimant's alleged failure to meet the design specifications and the resulting delays in the construction process. Please provide any documentation or correspondence that supports your claim.
