(claimant): I am the claimant and I would like to present my reasons and evidence to support my claim. The Respondent maliciously delayed the payment of the design fee, which constitutes a breach of contract. I request that the Respondent pay the design fee as specified in the contract (32000 USD) and the delay liquidated damages of 9000 USD. Additionally, I request that the Respondent pay the arbitration fee of 3000 USD. I have documents and correspondence that support my claim and I am willing to present them as evidence.
(arbitrator): Thank you, Claimant. Please present your evidence to support your claim.
(Allow the Claimant to present their evidence)
Arbitrator: Thank you for presenting your evidence. Respondent, do you have any response or evidence to present?
(arbitrator): Respondent, please present your defense and any evidence to support it.
(arbitrator): Thank you for your response, Respondent. Could you provide any evidence to support your defense?
(arbitrator): Good morning everyone. As the arbitrator for this case, I will preside over this hearing and ensure that the arbitration process and rules are followed. I would like to invite the Claimant to present their case and evidence to support their claim for the outstanding design fee and liquidated damages for the delay. Please provide any relevant documents, contracts, or correspondence that helps substantiate your position.
(arbitrator): Thank you, Claimant. Now, I would like to invite the Respondent to respond to the claim and provide their evidence to support their defense. Please provide any relevant documents, contracts, or correspondence that helps substantiate your position.
(arbitrator): Thank you, Respondent. I have reviewed the evidence presented by both parties and will now proceed to make a decision. Based on the evidence presented, it is clear that the Respondent did delay in payment of the design fee. Therefore, I find in favor of the Claimant and order the Respondent to pay the outstanding design fee of 32000 USD, as well as the liquidated damages for the delay. Additionally, as the Claimant has prevailed in this arbitration, I order the Respondent to bear the arbitration fees. Thank you all for your participation in this hearing.
(arbitrator): Is there anything else that either party would like to add or clarify before we conclude this hearing?
(claimant): Thank you, arbitrator. I appreciate your decision in favor of the Claimant. I believe that this outcome is fair and just for both parties.
(respondent): Respectfully, I disagree with the decision made by the arbitrator. While I acknowledge that there was a delay in payment, we had valid reasons for withholding the payment. Our evidence shows that the Claimant did not fulfill their obligations as per the contract, which led to the delay in the project completion. Therefore, I request the arbitrator to reconsider the decision and take our evidence into consideration.
(respondent): As evidence to support our defense, we have documentation that shows the Claimant did not meet the project milestones as stipulated in the contract. This caused significant delays in the project timeline and ultimately led to the delayed payment. We believe that this evidence should be taken into account and that the decision should be re-evaluated.
(respondent): Furthermore, we have expert reports that demonstrate the inadequacy of the design provided by the Claimant. The design did not meet the required standards, which led to additional costs and delays in the construction process. We believe that this evidence is crucial to our defense and should be considered by the arbitrator.
(respondent): In light of this evidence, we request that the arbitrator reconsiders their decision and takes into account the Claimant's failure to fulfill their obligations as per the contract. We believe that a fair and just outcome would be to reduce the amount of the outstanding design fee, taking into account the delays and additional costs caused by the Claimant's inadequate design. Thank you for your consideration.
(arbitrator): Thank you, Respondent, for presenting your evidence and defense. I will review the documentation and expert reports you have provided and reconsider my decision. I will inform both parties of my revised decision as soon as possible. Thank you for your participation in this hearing.
(arbitrator): As the arbitrator, I will carefully review the evidence and take into account both parties' arguments before making a final decision. I understand that both parties have valid concerns, and my goal is to find a solution that is acceptable for both parties. Thank you for your patience as I review the evidence and reconsider my decision.
(claimant): Thank you, arbitrator. As the Claimant, I understand the Respondent's concerns and appreciate their evidence. However, I would like to reiterate that we fulfilled our obligations as per the contract and provided a design that met the required standards. We also completed the project within the agreed-upon timeline. We believe that the original decision was fair and just, but we are open to discussing a compromise that is acceptable for both parties. Thank you for your consideration.
(claimant): As evidence to support our claim, we have provided documentation and correspondence that clearly shows the delay in payment of the design fee by the Respondent. We also have evidence of the liquidated damages incurred as a result of the delay. We believe that the original decision was fair and just, but we are open to discussing a compromise that is acceptable for both parties. Thank you, arbitrator.
(claimant): To support our claim, we have also provided expert reports that demonstrate the adequacy of our design and our compliance with the project milestones as stipulated in the contract. We believe that this evidence shows that we fulfilled our obligations as per the contract and that the original decision was fair and just. However, we remain open to discussing a compromise that is acceptable for both parties. Thank you, arbitrator.
(claimant): In light of the Respondent's evidence and concerns, the Claimant is willing to consider a compromise that takes into account the additional costs and delays caused by the alleged inadequacy of our design. We believe that a fair and just outcome can be reached through open and constructive dialogue between both parties. Thank you, arbitrator.
(arbitrator): Thank you, Claimant, for your additional evidence and willingness to consider a compromise. I appreciate your efforts to find a solution that is acceptable for both parties. As the arbitrator, I will carefully review all the evidence presented and consider any possible compromises. I will inform both parties of my final decision as soon as possible. Thank you all for your participation in this hearing.
(arbitrator): After reviewing all the evidence presented by both parties and considering possible compromises, I have made my final decision. I find that while there was a delay in payment by the Respondent, the evidence presented by the Respondent also shows inadequacy in the design provided by the Claimant, which led to additional costs and delays. As such, I order the Respondent to pay the Claimant an adjusted design fee of 28000 USD, taking into account the delays and additional costs caused by the inadequate design. Additionally, I order the Respondent to pay the liquidated damages incurred as a result of the delay. Both parties will bear their own arbitration fees. Thank you all for your participation in this hearing, and I hope that this outcome can be accepted by both parties.
(claimant): Thank you, arbitrator, for your final decision. As the Claimant, we accept the decision and appreciate the efforts made to find a compromise that is acceptable for both parties. We hope that this outcome will lead to a positive resolution for both parties. Thank you again for your time and consideration.
(arbitrator): Thank you, Claimant, for accepting the final decision. Respondent, I understand that this may not have been the outcome you were hoping for, but I hope that you can also accept the decision and move forward from this dispute. Thank you all for your participation in this arbitration, and I wish you both the best in your future endeavors. This hearing is now concluded.
(claimant): Thank you, arbitrator. We are grateful for your efforts in finding a solution that is acceptable for both parties. We will accept the adjusted design fee and hope that this can lead to a positive resolution for both parties. Thank you again for your time and consideration.
